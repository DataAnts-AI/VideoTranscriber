# Video Transcriber

## Project Overview
The video Recording Transcriber is a Python application built with Streamlit that processes video recordings (particularly from OBS Studio) to generate transcripts and summaries using AI models. The application uses Whisper for transcription and Hugging Face Transformers for summarization.

## Key Improvement Areas

### 1. UI Enhancements
- **Implemented:**
  - Responsive layout with columns for better organization
  - Expanded sidebar with categorized settings
  - Custom CSS for improved button styling
  - Spinner for long-running operations
  - Expanded transcript view by default

- **Additional Recommendations:**
  - Add a dark mode toggle
  - Implement progress bars for each processing step
  - Add tooltips for complex options
  - Create a dashboard view for batch processing results
  - Add visualization of transcript segments with timestamps

### 2. Ollama Local API Integration
- **Implemented:**
  - Local API integration for offline summarization
  - Model selection from available Ollama models
  - Chunking for long texts
  - Fallback to online models when Ollama fails

- **Additional Recommendations:**
  - Add temperature and other generation parameters as advanced options
  - Implement streaming responses for real-time feedback
  - Cache results to avoid reprocessing
  - Add support for custom Ollama model creation with specific instructions
  - Implement parallel processing for multiple chunks

### 3. Subtitle Export Formats
- **Implemented:**
  - SRT export with proper formatting
  - ASS export with basic styling
  - Multi-format export options
  - Automatic segment creation from plain text

- **Additional Recommendations:**
  - Add customizable styling options for ASS subtitles
  - Implement subtitle editing before export
  - Add support for VTT format for web videos
  - Implement subtitle timing adjustment
  - Add batch export for multiple files

### 4. Architecture and Code Quality
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement proper error handling and logging throughout
  - Add unit tests for critical components
  - Create a configuration file for default settings
  - Implement caching for processed files
  - Add type hints throughout the codebase
  - Document API endpoints for potential future web service

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement parallel processing for batch operations
  - Add GPU acceleration configuration options
  - Optimize memory usage for large files
  - Implement incremental processing for very long recordings
  - Add compression options for exported files

### 6. Additional Features
- **Recommendations:**
  - Speaker diarization (identifying different speakers)
  - Language detection and translation
  - Keyword extraction and timestamp linking
  - Integration with video editing software
  - Batch processing queue with email notifications
  - Custom vocabulary for domain-specific terminology

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Phase 1 (Completed):** Basic UI improvements, Ollama integration, and subtitle export
2. **Phase 2 (Completed):** Performance optimizations and additional export formats
   - Added WebVTT export format for web videos
   - Implemented GPU acceleration with automatic device selection
   - Added caching system for faster processing of previously transcribed files
   - Optimized memory usage with configurable memory limits
   - Added compression options for exported files
   - Enhanced ASS subtitle styling options
   - Added progress indicators for better user feedback
3. **Phase 3 (Completed):** Advanced features like speaker diarization and translation
   - Implemented speaker diarization to identify different speakers in recordings
   - Added language detection and translation capabilities
   - Integrated keyword extraction with timestamp linking
   - Created interactive transcript with keyword highlighting
   - Added named entity recognition for better content analysis
   - Generated keyword index with timestamp references
   - Provided speaker statistics and word count analysis
4. **Phase 4:** Integration with other tools and services

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure compatibility with different Whisper model sizes
- Handle large files efficiently to prevent memory issues
- Provide graceful degradation when optional dependencies are missing
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Consider containerization for easier deployment

## Conclusion
The OBS Recording Transcriber has a solid foundation but can be significantly enhanced with the suggested improvements. The focus should be on improving user experience, adding offline processing capabilities, and expanding export options to make the tool more versatile for different use cases.
