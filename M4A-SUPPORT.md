# ðŸŽµ M4A Audio File Support

VideoTranscriber now supports M4A audio files! This format is commonly used by:
- Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
- Voice recording apps
- Audio podcasts and interviews
- High-quality audio recordings

## What's New

### Supported Formats
- **Video**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV
- **Audio**: M4A âœ¨ (NEW!)

### How It Works

1. **Direct Processing**: M4A files are processed directly without audio extraction
2. **Same Features**: All transcription and summarization features work with M4A
3. **Optimized Performance**: Faster processing since no video-to-audio conversion needed

## Usage Examples

### Common M4A Sources

#### iPhone Voice Memos
```
/Users/yourname/Desktop/recordings/
â”œâ”€â”€ meeting_notes.m4a
â”œâ”€â”€ interview.m4a
â””â”€â”€ lecture.m4a
```

#### Podcast Recordings
```
/path/to/podcast/
â”œâ”€â”€ episode_001.m4a
â”œâ”€â”€ episode_002.m4a
â””â”€â”€ bonus_content.m4a
```

#### Professional Audio
```
/path/to/audio/
â”œâ”€â”€ conference_call.m4a
â”œâ”€â”€ client_interview.m4a
â””â”€â”€ webinar_recording.m4a
```

## Technical Details

### File Processing
- **M4A Files**: Processed directly by Whisper (no conversion needed)
- **Video Files**: Audio extracted first, then processed
- **Performance**: M4A processing is faster due to no extraction step

### Quality Considerations
- M4A supports high-quality audio compression
- Better quality = more accurate transcription
- Recommended: 44.1kHz, 16-bit or higher

### Supported Features with M4A
- âœ… **Transcription**: Full Whisper model support
- âœ… **Summarization**: Ollama and HuggingFace models
- âœ… **Speaker Diarization**: Identify different speakers
- âœ… **Translation**: Multi-language support
- âœ… **Keyword Extraction**: Important terms with timestamps
- âœ… **Export Formats**: SRT, ASS, VTT subtitles
- âœ… **Caching**: Faster re-processing

## Getting Started

1. **Place M4A files** in your designated recordings folder
2. **Launch VideoTranscriber**
3. **Select folder** containing your M4A files
4. **Choose file** from dropdown (M4A files will appear alongside videos)
5. **Process** as normal - all features work identically!

## Troubleshooting

### M4A Files Not Appearing
- Check file extension is `.m4a` (lowercase)
- Ensure files are in the selected folder
- Verify no file corruption

### Processing Issues
- M4A files with DRM protection may not work
- Very large files (>2GB) may need more memory
- Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed

### Quality Issues
- Low-quality recordings may have poor transcription
- Background noise affects accuracy
- Consider noise reduction before processing

## Comparison: M4A vs Video Files

| Feature | M4A Files | Video Files |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Processing Speed | âš¡ Faster | Slower (audio extraction needed) |
| File Size | ðŸ“¦ Smaller | Larger |
| Quality | ðŸŽµ Audio-optimized | May have video artifacts |
| Compatibility | âœ… Direct support | âœ… Supported (via extraction) |
| Use Cases | Interviews, podcasts, meetings | Screen recordings, presentations |

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for audio file support:
- Additional audio formats (WAV, FLAC, AAC)
- Batch processing for multiple M4A files
- Audio quality analysis and optimization suggestions
- Integration with cloud audio services
