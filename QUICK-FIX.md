# 🚨 Quick Fix for PyTorch Compatibility Error

If you're seeing the `torch.compiler.disable` error, here's how to fix it:

## Immediate Fix

```bash
# Stop the current container
docker-compose down

# Remove the old image to force rebuild with fixed versions
docker rmi $(docker images | grep videotranscriber | awk '{print $3}')

# Rebuild with fixed dependencies
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Better Solution: Use Prebuilt Images

⚠️ **Note**: GitHub Actions had a naming issue that's now fixed. See [FIX-GITHUB-ACTIONS.md](FIX-GITHUB-ACTIONS.md) for details.

Once prebuilt images are available, use them instead:

```bash
# Check if images are ready
docker pull ghcr.io/dataants-ai/videotranscriber:latest

# If successful, stop current container and use prebuilt image
docker-compose down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prebuilt.yml up -d
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Version Pinning**: Updated `requirements.txt` with compatible versions:
   - `torch==2.0.1` (was `>=1.7.0`)
   - `pytorch-lightning==2.0.6` (compatible with torch 2.0.1)
   - `pyannote.audio==3.1.1` (updated to compatible version)

2. **Build Process**: Removed duplicate PyTorch installation that could cause conflicts

3. **Prebuilt Images**: Created GitHub Actions to build reliable, tested images

## Verification

After fixing, you should see the Streamlit app load without errors at `http://localhost:8501`

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Clear Docker cache**:
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a
   ```

2. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

3. **Manual rebuild**:
   ```bash
   docker build --no-cache -t videotranscriber .
   ```
